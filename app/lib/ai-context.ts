## About Tyler Grant
Tyler is a Software Engineer currently working at Signos, based in Lehi, UT. He has over 4 years of professional experience building full-stack applications. He graduated from the University of Utah with a B.S. in Computer Science (GPA: 3.8) and has worked at companies including Signos, Sorenson Communications, Kantata, and Zions Bank.

## Tyler's Journey into Software Engineering
Tyler originally started college pursuing accounting—both his parents and his best friend's dad were accountants (one was a partner at a Big Four firm), so a job was practically guaranteed with a Masters and CPA. Everything changed during his second year when he took an advanced Excel course. One assignment required creating macros with VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), and for the first time, Tyler didn't hate a homework assignment. He went above and beyond, pushing VBA to its limits, and realized you actually CAN enjoy assignments.

The following semester, Tyler took computer science classes alongside accounting to test the waters. That's when he met his soon-to-be wife—who was also studying computer science. Everything felt like it was put in place for a reason. Assignments became fun; he'd complete them as soon as they came out, constantly refactoring and improving performance. He ended up getting his only C ever (in accounting that semester) because he had no interest in pursuing that degree anymore.

It was the best decision Tyler ever made to throw away 1+ years of accounting classes. To this day, he loves his job and his decision to become a software engineer. He also loves that his wife shares the same passion for software engineering.

## Personal Life & Family
- **Wife:** Also a software engineer with her Master's degree. She told Tyler if he got a solid job above a certain salary threshold, he could skip getting his Master's. Challenge accepted—that led him to Sorenson Communications and graduating with just his Bachelor's. No regrets.
- **Son:** 2 years old and means the world to Tyler. He's like his father—non-stop energy, never stops trying to accomplish whatever he sets his mind to. Basically potty-trained himself at 2¼ years. Everything he figures out amazes Tyler.

Tyler is a go-getter who can function with almost no sleep if it means helping someone else. He's constantly trying to make memories with his wife and kid outside of work.

## Self-Hosting Enthusiast
Tyler is very tech-savvy and loves new technologies, especially in a self-hosted aspect. He could talk for hours about how Home Assistant has made a difference in his life. Being a passionate software engineer, he doesn't like doing mundane tasks if he doesn't have to—always looking to improve automations and speed up pipelines.

**Self-hosted services Tyler runs:**
- Home Assistant (smart home automation)
- Plex Server (media streaming)
- Immich (self-hosted Google Photos alternative)
- Mealie (recipe management)
- And tons more

Tyler didn't create his portfolio website to find a job—he created it because of his passion. He loves tinkering and trying new things or new tech stacks.

## Hobbies & Interests
- **Basketball:** Plays in recreational leagues
- **Skiing:** Enjoys hitting the slopes
- **Tinkering with Tech:** Always exploring new technologies and self-hosting solutions
- **Cabinetry & Woodworking:** Builds custom projects in his workshop
